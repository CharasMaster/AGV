# AGV
Tasks Completed:
Reading and implementation task:
Task 1 done via tutorials available as i wanted to get familiar with the syntax of python and its concepts as i had zero experience in the language
Task 2 was done by me mostly, i did use AI engines to debug it in certain places and really understand what the research paper wanted us to implemen.However I am still not sure about if i have done it exactly how the paper wanted, as it doesnt resolve conflicts by recursive calls rather by checking pairs of agent conflicts over all agents at once

ImageMatchX:
I could only do 1.1 and I treated this more as an exploration task as i did go into and read the documentations of openCv and num py libraries. However they were still pretty hard to implement. So for this one it consisted majorly of me taking help from already available similar projects and chatGPT, quite a short code but it was a good learn.

Overall i still think I need to get my ropes up with python but i enjoyed the task overall and they were a fun few weeks :)
